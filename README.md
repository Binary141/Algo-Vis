# Algo-Vis

## What is it?
This is a Linux GUI application to be able to help visualize how different search algorithms find the goal. There starts with an empty grid where the user can select a start tile, a goal tile, and add "walls" that get in the way of the search algorithm.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch algorithms in action with step-by-step visualization.
- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**: Includes Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Astar, and Greedy searches.
-  **Multiple Heuristics Supported**: Watch how different heuristics affect the results of a search.
- **Customization**: Adjust the grid to see how algorithms behave under different conditions.
- **Educational Resource**: Useful for students, educators, and anyone interested in algorithms to learn and understand their inner workings.

## Setup
First download the SDL packages that are listed in the `install_packages.sh`. Then you can run `make run` which will build and launch the program. All intermediate files are placed in the `build` directory, with the executable being placed in the root of the directory. 

## Usage
Once ran, press `m` for the menu, and explore the different ways to interact with the program.
